This site is run by Phil Ewels, a bioinformatician working in Stockholm, Sweden.
I work with data analysis for next-generation sequencing projects, with an interest
in epigenetics. I have also written several bioinformatics tools and develop core
bioinformatics services at [NGI Sweden](https://ngisweden.scilifelab.se/).

You can find out more about me (including tools and publications) at

This website is generated using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
It uses some JavaScript magic to load blog pages without refreshing the
page with the help of [history.js](https://github.com/browserstate/history.js)
(original idea for this is [here](https://github.com/joelhans/Jekyll-AJAX)).
You can find the source code for this website on GitHub:
