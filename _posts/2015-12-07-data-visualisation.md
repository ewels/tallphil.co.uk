I gave a talk in Cambridge last week as part of the [Enabling Excellence European Training Network](https://eetraining.wordpress.com/) kick off meeting. Â I spoke about effective data visualisation and how to use nice colours and fonts when designing visual aids.

I hope this is useful for some others. Please feel free to leave any comments on the [slide share page](http://www.slideshare.net/tallphil/using-visual-aids-effectively).
