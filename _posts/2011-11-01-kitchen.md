![Kitchen Comments]({{ site.baseurl | prepend: site.github.url }}/files/2011/kitchen_comments.png)

My college, Trinity Hall, was recently in need of a new system to allow students and staff to comment on Hall food. As I couldn't find anything that specifically met our need, I put together a standalone package.

It's written in PHP and mySQL, and uses the excellent 

[jQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/) and [jQuery Validate plugin](http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/).

Features:

  * Require Cambridge login using [Raven](http://raven.cam.ac.uk/)
  * Comments require moderation 
      * SCR, MCR and JCR each have their own moderators. These can be updated through the web interface.
  * Once moderated, kitchen staff are e-mailed about the comment, and can reply 
      * Kitchen staff are also listed by CRSID and do not see commenting interface
  * Original commenter is e-mailed upon approval and reply
  * Users can also rate cafeteria food for quality and value using sliders
  * Moderators can delete comments, even after approval and reply
  * Users can delete their own comments, even after approval and reply
  * Optional lists of SCR, MCR and JCR members can be filled, and the system closed to anyone not on those lists. 
      * These lists can also be updated through the web interface.

I have released the package with a [GNU General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html), meaning that anyone is free to use and modify the code as they need (though please leave the licence and credit in place). Cambridge colleges can easily use the system, [hosted on the SRCF](http://kcomments.soc.srcf.net/). Alternatively, you can **[download the comments package](http://kcomments.soc.srcf.net/kcomments.zip "Cambridge Kitchen Comments Download").**
