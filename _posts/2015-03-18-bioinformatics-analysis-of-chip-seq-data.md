This morning I gave a talk for PhD students and postdocs as part of the "Epigenetics and its applications in clinical research" course at the Karolinska Institute. The talk was a pretty general introduction to ChIP-Seq and it's analysis, so I thought others may find it useful.

Please note that this talk is by nature biased towards my own experience and preferences with ChIP-Seq analysis. Hopefully it will be clear from the talk, but I believe that there is no right or wrong when it comes to this stuff. These are just some notes from the road..
