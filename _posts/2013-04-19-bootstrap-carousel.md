> A WordPress plugin to make choosing images and content for the Bootstrap Image Carousel easy. Available from the [WordPress Plugin Repository](http://wordpress.org/plugins/cpt-bootstrap-carousel/).

I've been working in WordPress with Bootstrap as a back end for themes a lot lately. On a recent site I wanted a simple image slider couldn't find anything that did what I wanted. So I did what any good WP developer should - 

[I wrote a plugin that did.](http://wordpress.org/plugins/cpt-bootstrap-carousel/)

It should be noted at this point that there are already a couple of plugins that do similar things. [WP Bootstrap Carousel](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-bootstrap-carousel/) uses the same carousel but does lots of clever things to do with displaying the featured images of recent posts. There are also quite a few tutorials explaining how to integrate the [twitter bootstrap carousel](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#carousel) into themes.

How CPT Bootstrap Carousel differs is in its administration. The CPT stands for &#8216;custom post type', this is because once installed you get a new item on the WordPress admin menu called &#8216;Carousel'. Here you can add new items with a title and description and associated image (using WP Featured Image). This gives direct control over what goes into the carousel.

You can download the plugin from the [WordPress plugin repository](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/cpt-bootstrap-carousel/) or install it within your WordPress install by searching for **CPT Bootstrap Carousel**.

If you'd like to contribute code to the plugin, it's now also hosted on GitHub: [https://github.com/tallphil/cpt-bootstrap-carousel](https://github.com/tallphil/cpt-bootstrap-carousel)<figure id="attachment_837" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
