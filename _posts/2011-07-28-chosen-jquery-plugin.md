I just came across the [Chosen JavaScript plugin](http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/), thanks to a link on the excellent [CSS-Tricks](http://css-tricks.com/) RSS feed. It's a jQuery / Prototype plugin which turns regular HTML `<select>` dropdown boxes into functional uber-awesome units of happiness.

Previously, I've tended to opt for either standard dropdown select boxes or something like the 

[jQuery UI Autocomplete](http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/) (still awesome if the list you're selecting is massive). I think [Chosen](http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/) will become a standard include on every website I do from now on though, very impressed...
