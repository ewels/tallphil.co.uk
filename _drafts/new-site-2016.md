So my blog at tallphil.co.uk was hacked a few weeks ago and taken down by
spammers. I got it back up and running again, but it annoyed me - I've
been running a site there for years and it's under constant attack. I
feel that the WordPress installation has been getting increasingly
bloated and difficult to use, and this was the straw that broke the
camel's back.

So I've moved to Jekyll.

Migrating posts from my old site was ridiculously easy, made possible
with a WordPress plugin called
[Jekyll Exporter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/jekyll-exporter/) -
literally a one click tool which generated a load of markdown
files ready to dump straight into Jekyll.
